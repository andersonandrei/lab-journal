** 18:02 Meeting, org-journal                                      :OrgMode:

*** Starting on org-journal
**** Trying o do something in the org-jornal1. 
***** Creating a list
     1. Hello
     2. Hi
     3. Salut
	1. Ça vá?
     4. Learning how to do some lists
     5. Creating a lot of topics

*** Todays meeting:
**** Specified each part in the project.
**** Actually, we have two main layers to keep attention: scheduler and allocation.
**** My work will be on the allocation: *DO THE FIRST VERSION OF THE SCHEDULER*:
***** For this, I will use some data from:
****** The INPUT (jobs)
******* Priority
******* Client
******* etc
****** The QBoxes (status from each QBOX):
******* Local data
******* Status(how full it is)

  The installation of BATSIM is not working
:
* sexta, 08-02-2019
** Batsim
*** I installed it and performed the first example that includes: exectution and statistics.
*** If I understood well the structure. It is:
1. Batsim -> Simulates everything.
2. A scheduler -> Takes the decisions.

**** To see everything running, we can use 2 windows, one for each thing.
*NOTE:* Here, everything was setted to be in the /tmp.

#+NAME: batsim-side
#+BEGIN_SRC <bash> 
  batsim -p /tmp/batsim-v3.0.0/platforms/cluster512.xml        
         -w /tmp/batsim-v3.0.0/workloads/test_batsim_paper_workload_seed1.json
         -e "/tmp/expe-out/out"
#+END_SRC
It will keep the batsim oppened, waiting for the scheduler.

#+NAME: scheduler-side
#+BEGIN_SRC <bash>
  robin generate ./expe.yaml       
                    --output-dir=/tmp/expe-out       
                    --batcmd="batsim -p /tmp/batsim-v3.0.0/platforms/cluster512.xml 
                 -w /tmp/batsim-v3.0.0/workloads/test_batsim_paper_workload_seed1.json 
                 -e /tmp/expe-out/out"       
                    --schedcmd='batsched -v easy_bf'
#+END_SRC 
 It will use robin to run the scheduler batsched with the mode easy_bf.
** pybatsim
*** Runs a schedular for the batsim.
*** Configuration
**** To install by: pip install pybatsim
**** To clone [[https://gitlab.inria.fr/batsim/pybatsim][PyBatsim-repository]] to have access to the schedulers implemented there.
*** To run its scheduler:
**** To run the batsim as the same way.
**** To run the schedulers, acess the repository and try:
***** pybatsim schedulers/scheduler.py
**** I tried:
***** pybatsim schedulers/fillerSched.py
***** pybatsim schedulers/schedFcfs.py
** statistics
*** The batsim mainpage offer a example of statistic analysis:

                       longer_than_one_minute = execution_time > 60)

  # Manually compute aggregated metrics.
  # Here, the mean waiting time/slowdown for jobs with small execution time.
  metrics = jobs %>% filter(longer_than_one_minute == FALSE) %>%
    summarize(mean_waiting_time = mean(waiting_time),
              mean_slowdown = mean(slowdown))

  print(metrics) # Print aggregated metrics.

*** Running this analysis on both pybatsimexamples we can check the different results.

* segunda, 11-02-2019

** DONE To understand:
:LOGBOOK:  
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-02-11 seg 17:07]
:END:      

*** DONE The INPUT format for batsim;
:LOGBOOK:  
- State "DONE"       from "CANCELLED"  [2019-02-11 seg 17:07]
:END:      

*** DONE Some schedular examples;
:LOGBOOK:  
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-02-11 seg 17:07]
:END:

** The workflow:

*** Batsim-Scheduler communication:

**** Messages, JSON, via request-reply model:

***** Contraints format:

****** now

****** events

******* timestamp

******* type

******* data

****** And to differ the message, we change the *event type* as :

******* BIDIRECTIONAL

******* BATSIM => SCHEDULER

******* SCHEDULER => BATSIM

**** Workload:

***** The workload is an Input combined as:

****** Jobs: Users requests. It has:

******* id, subtime, res, profile, walltime, +
****** Profiles: Defines how the job execution should be simulated. It has:
******* type, etc. Where the type could be:
******** delay, prallel task, homogeneous pararllel task, etc.

*** Batsim requires to start:

**** a plataform; a workload; an output folder.

***** Providing a worload, it will have the jobs that should be scheduled.

**** Then, batsim will be learning, waiting for a scheduler to manage the jobs.

*** The scheduler:

**** Once the Batsim is already runnig, when we run the scheduler it will communicate with the Batsim by the messages, doing the requested decision.

**** The schdulers should implement all possible actions asked by the message types. For example: JobInitialize,kill,resquest. onBatSimInit,onJobSubmission, onJobCompletion.
*** An example:

**** I understood the fillerSched.py scheduler. It works following:

1. Initialize everything after Batsim intialized.
2. Schedule the jobs.
 2.2 _OnAfterBatsimInit_: // _Read_ a list of jobs *OpenJob* and a list of resources *availableResources* 
 2.1 _scheduleJobs_: // _Check_ all jobs in *OpenJob*
   2.1.1 _if_ (job.resourcesRequested > *aivailableResources*)
            discard it and remove from the *OpenJob*
   2.1.2 _else_
            scheduleJobs.append(job)
            *availableResources* -= jog.resourceRequested
            updateConsumptionTime
 2.2 _OnJobSubmission_:
  2.2.1 openJob.add(job)
  2.2.2 scheduleJobs()
 2.3 _OnJobCompletion_:
  2.3.1 *availableResources* += job.resourceRequested
  2.3.2 scheduleJobs()
**** I ran it as:
batsim -p platform52.xml -w test_batsim_paper_workload_seed1.json -e test-out-2
launcher.py scheduler/fillerSched.py

** Qarnot meeting
*** Administrative and update things with other teams.
*** About my part I should finish the current version of the QNodes scheduler. This way we will have a full system working.
*** With a full system working we will submit a paper to *SC2019*.
** Papers and techniques
*** I read the both papers that I selected on 06-02 and 12-02 and selected some algorthms to check later.
*** But, as our plan now is to finish the current scheduler version, I will work on the current code and think about improvements after (aka. read about techniques now).

 I did it on the fillerSched. Now I will start to try to write a pseudocode for the QNodes scheduler.
* sexta, 15-02-2019
** I should implement the algorithm of the Deliverable 2.2a. But, it asks for a function to predict the time to download a dataset for a specific QBox.
** I asked to Alex, by Slack, and he answered me that they do not have idea how to implement it now. So, I should skip it now, and after choose another rule to use.
** DONE Start to write a pseudocode to the algorithm on dlv.2.2a.

**** Mainly, I should put in the List only the QBoxes that already have ALL the required datasets from a job.
